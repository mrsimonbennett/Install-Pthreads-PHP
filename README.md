Install-Pthreads-PHP
====================

How I install Pthreads with PHP on my test servers. I will admit this might not be suitable for other users. 

This helps me when I need to set machines up for my Final major project at UNI. I got fed up of having to put them all in one by one.

Issues
------

Well to be honest this has being build for my needs. The install is very basic it does not handel questions well like mysql server passwords etc (you might even want it)

PHP tests on slow machines too take a while :( but I would ask people to submit the data at the end as it all helps :)
